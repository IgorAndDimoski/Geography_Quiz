# Geography_Quiz
Here is an ReadyToPlay Geography Quizz where you can learn all USA states names by guessing. I have created 2 versions,
In both versions i use classes OOP. And this excersice is example of, as your project grows how you can use OOP and organize your code better,
that way your code is easier to read and pleanty of room for upgrades. And this is where you can start and use your creativity.
One of the reason I love programing is that you can get from point A to Z in a hundreds of ways. 

As you run the Quiz I turn My Turtle into a USA map.
Then the prompt show up, and now you can make a guess and if you got it right I have ReadyToUse more Turtles which are going to the correct coordinates of the guessed state and write the state name over the territory.
You can keep guess and as you make correct gueses the scoreboard is updating with your live score.
Once you are done with guessing you may enter "Exit" on the prompt and when that happens a file "states_to_learn.csv" is created/updated with all states that you need to learn.
Hope you enjoy the Educational Quiz
